# Devhaus Tracking Code Contribution Guidelines
This page outlines how to contribute to the [Devhaus Tracking Code](https://github.com/BuildWithDevhaus/devhaus-tracking-code) and provides guidelines for code quality, testing, documentation, and communication.

## Getting Started
There are two types of contributions: [creating an issue](#create-new-issue) and [solving an issue](#solve-an-issue). However, contributors can also submit [pull requests](#pull-request) directly to add new features or functionality to the project. It's generally recommended to create an issue first for any new features or changes to discuss them with the project maintainers and other contributors. This helps ensure that the proposed changes align with the project's goals and coding standards, and allows for feedback and suggestions from others.

## Issue
Before creating issue, we recommend that you check our [Issue Page](https://github.com/BuildWithDevhaus/devhaus-tracking-code/issues) to see if any issues related to your interests or skills have already been raised. This will help you avoid duplicating efforts and ensure that your contributions are aligned with the project's goals and priorities.
After you make sure there's no issue related then you can start raise an Issue by yourself.

#### Create new Issue
* Click on the [Issues](https://github.com/BuildWithDevhaus/devhaus-tracking-code/issues) tab at the top of the page.
* Click on the green _"New issue"_ button on the right-hand side of the page.
* Write a **clear** and **descriptive** title for the issue that summarizes the problem or feature request.
* In the description field, provide more details about the issue, including:
* The steps to reproduce the problem (if applicable).
  - The expected behavior.
  - The actual behavior.
  - Any error messages or relevant information.
  - For feature requests, provide a clear description of the proposed feature and why it would be useful.
  - Add labels to categorize the issue (e.g., bug, enhancement, documentation, etc.).
  - Assign the issue to yourself or someone else if necessary.
  - Click on the green "Submit new issue" button at the bottom of the page.

#### Solve an Issue
* Assign the issue to yourself by clicking on the "Assignees" dropdown on the right-hand side of the issue page and selecting your username.
* Review the issue and make sure you understand the problem or feature request. If necessary, ask the original poster or other [contributors](https://github.com/BuildWithDevhaus/devhaus-tracking-code/graphs/contributors) for more information or clarification.
* Create a new branch to work on the issue. Name the branch something descriptive, like "fix-issue-123" or "add-feature-456".
* Make the necessary changes to the code or documentation to address the issue.
* Write clear, concise commit messages that describe the changes you made.
* Push your changes to the branch and submit a pull request (PR) to the main branch.
* In the PR description, provide a summary of the changes you made, why they were necessary, and how they address the issue. Reference the issue number in the PR description by typing "#<issue-number>" (e.g., "#123").
* Request code review from other [contributors](https://github.com/BuildWithDevhaus/devhaus-tracking-code/graphs/contributors) by assigning them to the PR or by mentioning them in a comment.


## Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Push your branch to [Devhaus Tracking Code](https://github.com/BuildWithDevhaus/devhaus-tracking-code) repository.
- Go to the original repository and click the "New Pull Request" button. Select your forked repository and the branch with your changes. Give your pull request a descriptive title and provide a detailed description of the changes you made and why they are necessary.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, the [contributors](https://github.com/BuildWithDevhaus/devhaus-tracking-code/graphs/contributors) member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
