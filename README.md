# Devhaus Tracking Code

Devhaus Tracking Code is a helper code snippet that helps Webflow developers mainly to implement [Segment](https://segment.com/) events and send them to multiple destinations (e.g. Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, etc.) without having to write any code. It also supports [Google Analytics 4](https://analytics.google.com) if the client opts out to track events without Segment in place.

# Installation and Configuration

The section below describes the process of installing and configuring the Devhaus Tracking Code snippet inside your Webflow project.

## How to Install

1. Take note of your Segment source's `writeKey`, **both for staging and production**.
2. Copy the code below and paste it in the `<head>` of the page and replace the `segment-prod-write-key` and `segment-dev-write-key` with your Segment source's `writeKey`:

```html
<script
  id="devhaus-tracking-code"
  defer
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/BuildWithDevhaus/devhaus-tracking-code@2.3.1/dist/index.js"
  segment-prod-write-key="YOUR_PRODUCTION_SOURCE_WRITE_KEY"
  segment-dev-write-key="YOUR_STAGING_SOURCE_WRITE_KEY"
></script>
```

3. In a case where you want to use Google Analytics 4 (GA4) without Segment, you can add the `ga4` **attribute** without the `segment-prod-write-key` and `segment-dev-write-key` attributes. [See this section below for more details](#enable-google-analytics-support-bypassing-segment).
4. If you want your site to always receive Devhaus Tracking Code updates, you can use the `latest` tag instead of the `X.X.X` version number. This will always point to the latest version of the script. **NOTE: This is not recommended for production sites since major updates may introduce breaking changes.**

```html
<script
  id="devhaus-tracking-code"
  defer
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/BuildWithDevhaus/devhaus-tracking-code@latest/dist/index.js"
  segment-prod-write-key="YOUR_PRODUCTION_SOURCE_WRITE_KEY"
  segment-dev-write-key="YOUR_STAGING_SOURCE_WRITE_KEY"
  production-domain="example.com"
  staging-domain="example.webflow.io"
></script>
```

## How to Install (v2.0.0 or lower)

1. Put your `analytics.js` snippet from Segment to the `<head>` of the page
2. **_(Optional) It is highly recommended_** that you modify your`analytics.js` file to include a staging source and a production source. This will allow you to test your events in staging before sending them to production. To do this, you need to add the following and \*\*replace to the `analytics.load()` call with the following\*\*:

```js if
(window.location.hostname.includes('webflow.io')) {
analytics.load('YOUR_STAGING_SOURCE_WRITE_KEY'); } else {
analytics.load('YOUR_PRODUCTION_SOURCE_WRITE_KEY'); }
</head>
```

3. Put the code below also in `<head>` after the `analytics.js` snippet; this is the Devhaus Tracking Code snippet:

```html
<script
  id="devhaus-tracking-code"
  defer
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/BuildWithDevhaus/devhaus-tracking-code@2.0/dist/index.js"
></script>
```

## Enable Analytics Tools Support without a CDP

By default, Devhaus Tracking Code is shipped with a CDP implementation considered in mind.

However, you can also use Devhaus Tracking Code without a CDP -- making it acts like a Tag Manager. In this case, you need to make sure that you omit the `segment-prod-write-key` and `segment-dev-write-key` attributes.

Below are the analytics tools that you can use:

- [Google Analytics 4 (GA4)](./docs/standalone_tools/ga4.md)
- [FullStory](/docs/standalone_tools/fullstory.md)
